# Randomized Optimization
    Narasimha Lakamsani - nlakamsani3@gatech.edu
This project has 2 phases. The first phase evaluates 4 different randomized optimization algorithms: Random Hill Climbing (RHC), Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Mutual Information Maximizing Input Clustering (MIMIC). They are analyzed on 3 different optimization problems. The second phase involves comparing the randomized optimization algorithms against backpropagation in a neural network classifier.


### Run Code Instuctions
* open collab notebook with models for dataset#1:  https://colab.research.google.com/github/naralakamsani/supervised_learning/blob/main/bike_sharing_demand.ipynb
* open collab notebook with models for dataset#2:  https://colab.research.google.com/github/naralakamsani/supervised_learning/blob/main/reservation_retention.ipynb
* Click on the runtime option above. Then proceed to click run all to run the entire notebooks
* note: It might take a while to finish running the whole notebooks, so it might be ideal to run only a few desired focused cells
